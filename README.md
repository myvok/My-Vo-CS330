JavaScript Programming Language Project
HISTORY

1. Language Name: JavaScript
2. Creation: JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way related to the Java programming language.
3. Primary uses: JavaScript is a multi-purpose language, but its primary use is for web development:
   - Web development (both front-end and back-end)
   - Mobile app development
   - Game development
   - Desktop application development (using frameworks like Electron)
   - Data visualization
   - Machine learning (using libraries like TensorFlow.js)
Examples of different projects:
   - Web applications: Facebook's front-end is largely built with JavaScript
   - Mobile apps: Instagram's mobile app is partly built using React Native
   - Desktop apps: Visual Studio Code is built using Electron
   - Servers: Netflix uses Node.js for its server-side operations
   - Games: Angry Birds has a web version built with JavaScript
4. Information sources:
   - Books: "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford, "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke
   - website URLs: (https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/introduction)

GETTING STARTED

1. Installation: JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for client-side web development, while Node is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. Therefore, to run JavaScript outside of the browser (such as in a terminal or for backend development), Node.js needs to be installed.
Steps to Install Node.js:
   - Go to the Node.js official website.
   - Download the recommended version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Follow the installation prompts for your system.
   - Verify the installation on command prompt
     
2. Programming Environment:
JavaScript may be written in any text editor, however for JavaScript development, there are a few widely used Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and code editors that offer useful features:
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A free, open-source editor by Microsoft with excellent JavaScript support.
   - WebStorm: A powerful JavaScript IDE by JetBrains (paid, with free trial available).
   - Atom: A free, open-source editor by GitHub.

For this project, I'll be using Visual Studio Code due to its robust features, extensive plugin ecosystem, and strong community support.

3. Writing Comments:
JavaScript supports two types of comments:
   - Single-line comments: Begin with //
   - Multi-line comments: Enclosed between /* and */
  
Hello World Program

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in JavaScript:

console.log("Hello, World!");
